# LeoCodes 

Welcome to my portfolio. It's a website, but it thinks it's a Macintosh from 1997.

I built this because I miss the days when computers made satisfying clicking sounds and didn't track your every move. It's built with **React**, but styled to look like System 6/7 using the awesome `System.css` library.

## What works?
Pretty much everything you see.
- **Windows**: Drag them, resize them, close them. They behave like you expect.
- **Doom**: Yeah, the shareware version of Doom is in here. Double-click the "Games" folder. You're welcome.
- **Files**: The icons actually do things. "About Me" opens a window, "Projects" shows my work.
- **Sound**: It clicks and beeps. (You can mute your tab if you hate fun).

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript 
- Vite
- System.css (for the retro vibes)
- EmailJS (for the contact form)

## Running it locally
If you want to poke around the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonardonapoless/leocodes.git
cd leocodes
npm install
npm run dev
```
