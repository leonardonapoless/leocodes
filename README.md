# LeoCodes - Portfolio ️

Hey! Welcome to my retro Mac OS portfolio.

I built this because I miss the aesthetic of System 7/8. It's a React app powered by Vite, using `system.css` for the looks.

## Stuff to do here:
- **About Me**: A bit about who I am.
- **Projects**: Check out my iOS and web work.
- **Contact Me**: Send me an email (it actually works!).
- **Games**: Yes, you can play DOOM.

## Running it
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Windows are draggable and resizable.
- Double-click title bars to shade them.
- Drag icons around if you want.

Enjoy the nostalgia!
